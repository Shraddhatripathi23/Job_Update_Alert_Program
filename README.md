#### Overview:

The Job Update Alert Program is a Python application designed to help job seekers stay informed about new job postings that match their criteria. It automates the process of searching for jobs on various job boards and sends alerts to the user when relevant positions are found.

#### Features:

1. **Job Search and Aggregation:**
   - The program will utilize web scraping or API integration to search and aggregate job listings from popular job boards (e.g., LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor) based on the user's specified criteria.

2. **Matching Algorithm:**
   - The program will implement a matching algorithm to filter job listings based on the user's profile. It will consider factors like job title, location, skills, experience, and industry preferences.

3. **Customizable Alert Frequency:**
   - Users can set the frequency of alerts (e.g., daily, weekly) based on their preferences.

5. **Data Privacy and Security:**
   - The program will ensure that user data is handled securely, adhering to privacy regulations and best practices.


#### Technology Stack:

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Web Scraping/API:** BeautifulSoup API libraries
- **Web Framework (optional):** Flask, Django (for user interface)

#### Next Steps:

- Define the specific Role this will take all  platforms to be included in the search.
- Implement the web scraping or API integration for job data retrieval.
- Develop the matching algorithm to filter job listings based on user preferences.
